![The Game of Life in action](lifesim01.gif)
A life simulator based on John Horton Conway's algorithm.

*Lifesim* is my own version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It's not the first time I work with this algorithm, as I already produced an implementation of it on my [Commodore AMIGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) back in 1997. Actually, this 2007 version is a port of the 1997 release to Windows, Linux and OS X.

## How to run it
If you are under Windows, simply run *lifesim01.exe*.

Linux users can try to use Wine, it works for me (that's how I took the screen captures): `wine ./lifesim01.exe`. You might have to run `winecfg`, go to the *Graphics* tab and tick *Emulate a virtual desktop*.

OS X users will have to download, install and setup the [BlitzMax compiler](https://blitzmax.org/downloads/).
